### 1) Setting up of a synchronizer at the receiver.
### 2) Implementation of a Phase-Locked Loop for phase and frequency compensation.
### 3) Preamble detection with a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLR)
### 4) Modeling and simulation of time- and frequency-selective channels: channel equalization techniques to combat inter-symbol interference.
### 5) ** COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) Transmission **
